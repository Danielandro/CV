## Daniel Ajilore

I am a software engineer, gratuating from Makers Academy in August 2019. I have been indoctrinated in the church of test driven development, Agile process & XP values, but am open to understanding alternative ways of reaching the promised land. Before Makers, I worked in hospitality, genrally in hyphenated roles, as a barista, hospitality assistant and events supervisor. Being the face of plans, sometimes made months in advance, my ability to be forward thinking, calm under pressure and attentive to the sometimes unreasaonable demands of clients was frequently tested and strengthened.

## Skills

#### Test Driven Development(TDD)

#### Quick Learner

During my previous hospitality roles, I have always had to adapt to new work environments & quickly acquire skills. I learnt barista skills through a combination of observation and practice. I also picked up the processes required from hospitality when setting meeting rooms, and providing formal dinner service.

#### Test Driven Development(TDD)

One of the keystone habits, utilising TDD has been especially helpful as a learning tool. It has forced me to think about how to structure code in order to make it testable, to iterate in small steps when approaching a problem & finding the most simple unit to test first.

## Experience

**Vacherin Ltd** (2012 - 2017)    
*Events Supervisor* 

After an initial learning curve, getting familiar with my new role as a hospitality assistant - I took on the responsibilty of managing our large scale events spaces whilst the manager was on extended leave. Within six months, I was promoted to events supervisor managing the large event spaces, as well as providing support to the hospitality, cafe, kitchen and management teams.  


**Smart Hospitality** (2011 - 2012)   
*Cafe Assistant/Events Supervisor*  

After a stint working as agency staff, I was taken on intially to work in the cafe where I had to quickly learn what a cappuccino was and how it wasn't a latte. I expanded into into an events role, providing service for daytime and evening events within our meeting spaces, aswell as in the gallery - with a promotion to events supervisor within six months.
